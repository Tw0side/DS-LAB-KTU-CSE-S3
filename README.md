DS-LAB-KTU-CSE-S3
This repository contains the programs of Data Structures Lab for CSE branch, 2019 scheme, as per the syllabus of APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU). The programs are written in C language and demonstrate the implementation and application of various data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, and hashing.

Next, add sections that describe the requirements, installation, and usage of your project. You can use headings, subheadings, lists, code blocks, and other elements to organize and present the information. For example:
